# The RGB Color Guessing Game
## What is it?
A javascript-run game where you try to guess which square has the stated RGB value. The correct RGB is randomly calculated each time and assigned to a random square in the grid. The rest of the grid is filled with random colors. There is an easy setting (3 squares) and a hard setting (6 choices). 

## How was it made?
Uses Bootstrap (v4 alpha 6) for responsive design and grid styling.

Uses Vanilla JavaScript to generate the RGB values, color squares, and interactivity.

Uses CSS for smooth transitions between events.
